His films are noted for their suspenseful narratives, innovative practical effects, and deep psychological themes.

In 2023, after the failure of the newest entry into the Knife Killer series, Momosaki came back to his birthplace of Karakura and attempted to direct *Trouble in Paradise*, produced in collaboration with Netflix, Warner Bros.

The film featured a cast of hollywood alumni and local stars/celebrities including Pluto Donnadieu, Lernaean Herrington, Aaron Paul, and Bruce Hanks, and explores themes of psychological horror and societal tension rising in the island. Before the release of the film, the director was kidnapped by the real life versions of who the film is based on - the cult called Triad (no relation to the Chinese Mafia.)
