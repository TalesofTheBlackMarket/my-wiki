It is the largest island in the archipelago. The island is known globally for its rich history, diverse culture as it is one of Japan's only immigration hubs and crime issues relative to Takashima City in Japan or the region of Furness in the United Kingdom.</p>"},{"location":"karakura/#geography","title":"Geography","text":"<p>Karakura spans an area of 102.25 km\u00b2 and is characterized by its mountainous terrain, particularly the Kohaku mountain range, which forms natural borders around the island. The island's proximity to mainland Japan, including cities like Tateyama in Chiba Prefecture and Yokosuka in Kanagawa Prefecture, influences its climate and biodiversity. Notably, the nearby Oshima Island, famous for its active volcano, affects weather patterns and wildlife on Karakura.</p>"},{"location":"karakura/#history","title":"History","text":""},{"location":"karakura/#nara-and-heian-periods-7101192","title":"Nara and Heian Periods (710\u20131192)","text":"<p>During the Nara and Heian periods, The Island's inhabitants primarily engaged in fishing, hunting, and gathering. Cultural influences from China were prevalent, but over time, Japanese script and literature developed, leading to a decline in Chinese influence. Buddhist sects on the island adapted to Japanese preferences. Otherwise, at some point Soroist settlers had also immigrated to the Island, constructing various religious artifacts such as the named statue, 'The Weeping Maiden.' located in the former Furukawa Estate (formally called the Herrington Estate.) as well as various other non-shinto structures located in the mountains.</p>"},{"location":"karakura/#kamakura-period-11921333","title":"Kamakura Period (1192\u20131333)","text":"<p>With the rise of the Kamakura Shogunate, the Nashima Clan emerged as a prominent samurai family on the Island. The clan played a significant role in the island's governance and military affairs during this period, starting an age that continues to this day of the island being in constant flux due to political and social infighting, a trend that has carried on in different forms and variations up till this very day. In 1228, the second variation of Karakura's monastery was constructed.</p>"},{"location":"karakura/#muromachi-period-1338-1573","title":"Muromachi Period (1338-1573)","text":"<p>The unfolding of the Nashima Clan going into the Muromachi Period led to new infighting. This period faced tension due to political strife and infighting between two competing imperial courts, the Northern Court and the Southern Court until the Northern Court took superiority. During Shogun Ashikaga Yoshimitsu\u2019s reign over Japan and officially in 1373, the island\u2019s governance was officially isolated from the larger country. The 1540s marked the first instance of foreigner influence on the region as Portuguese and Jesuit traders introduced firearms and Christianity to the region, possibly due to heightening tensions between the island and the mainland.</p>"},{"location":"karakura/#azuchi-momoyama-period-1573-1603","title":"Azuchi-Momoyama Period (1573-1603)","text":"<p>A great warring period full of strife. The \u2018Great Unifer\u2019 Oda Nobunaga came for Karakura and once again united it to the mainland and left Karakura in a crippled and weakened state which further radicalised the island. Under this new administration was a sea of deeply unpopular political moves, such as a state-enforced disarmament which would create a need for a sort of \u2018black market\u2019 contraband trade network as well as an outlawing of Christianity and the complete and utter wiping out of Soroist cells, which were deemed too \u2018radical\u2019, which also led to the eventual erasure of their culture on the island as the religion was also unpopular amongst the citizenry of the island. This ruling under Nobunaga\u2019s forces only lasted twelve years but was incredibly influential for what would come.</p>"},{"location":"karakura/#edo-period-1603-1868","title":"Edo Period (1603-1868)","text":"<p>Under Tokugawa Ieyasu, Karakura was assigned a daimyo, Hishison Kota, who defied central control and effectively began the island\u2019s pseudo-independence. His leadership allowed Karakura\u2019s eccentric kabukimono, which were street gangs of violent and unconventional figures, first seen in 1615 to flourish at night. Patriotic families, including the Nashima, Saiky, and Moritachi clans, rebuilt the Kisune monastery as the Shinsei Seinaru Monastery in 1617, which remains an important historical site. In 1622, a fire in the Ochiba forest was linked to aspiring kabukimono called the H\u014dka-han Senshi, who caused chaos until fading out by the 1650s. Later, the Takagi Clan, renowned for education and knowledge, allied with the Kaseya Clan through marriage. Their descendants, the Itsbyoshi Families, organized Karakura\u2019s governance, creating the Itsbyoshi Court in 1691. This court oversaw justice, laws, and decrees, marking the Ky\u014ddaina Era, a celebrated golden age of prosperity and order on the island. </p>"},{"location":"karakura/#meiji-period-1868-1912","title":"Meiji Period (1868-1912)","text":"<p>The Meiji Restoration of 1868 ended Tokugawa rule, establishing an Imperial system and introducing Western-style reforms. In Karakura, these changes brought newfound freedoms, welcomed by some but secretly opposed by clans like the Itsbyoshi, who outwardly displayed patriotism while privately resisting foreign influence. The Itsbyoshi controlled the local shrine, enforcing traditional decorum despite the Westernizing trend. By 1892, Karakura\u2019s economy flourished through silk, cloth, and oak exports, attracting migrants and boosting industries such as education. The disbandment of the Itsbyoshi Court prior to this boom suggested the island prospered without a ruling family, possibly linked to the revealing actions of the Nashima Clan. However, in 1905, the Second Karakura Criminal Wave struck, crippling the economy and tarnishing the island\u2019s reputation.</p>"},{"location":"karakura/#taisho-and-showa-periods-1912-1926-1926-1989","title":"Taish\u014d and Sh\u014dwa Periods (1912-1926, 1926-1989)","text":"<p>Emperor Taisho\u2019s rise in 1912 coincided with global conflict, and Karakura, still reeling from its Second Criminal Wave, suffered greatly during World War I. Nearly 30% of the population left to serve, causing economic collapse, and only 14% returned, plunging the island into mourning. Postwar disasters continued: the 1924 Great Kanto Earthquake destroyed much of the city, and a 1935 rockslide killed 56 people, further reducing the population and stunting education. During World War II, Karakura endured another exodus of soldiers and three bombings in 1941 in the northwest, July 1943 in the city center, and later that year along the Kaiga coast, leaving the island devastated once again. Following World War II, the Government of Karakura was formed in 1946 and the now overwhelmed post-war Karakura Police Department requested support from the Tokyo Prefecture to help with the crime rate which resulted in the National Police Agency to be able to set up a Karakuran branch of the Tokushu Ky\u016bsh\u016b Butai (Special Assault Team.) in Karakura which was a deeply controversial move as the island prided itself on its individualism and ability to self-govern, a sentiment that deepened following a clash with the unnamed cultic-sewer-dwelling group, colloquially referred to as \u2018The Skulls\u2019, the last remaining followers of Soroism following Oda Nobunaga\u2019s attacks in the Azuchi-Momoyama Period.</p>"},{"location":"karakura/#heisei-period-1989-2019","title":"Heisei Period (1989-2019)","text":"<p>A new wave of immigration occurred as the island became a hub for foreigners seeking a new life, coinciding with massive underhauls and advancements in infrastructure under mixed effort. This led to a westernisation of the island and a constant tug-of-war battle surrounding foreign influence. In 2005, the Masamura train station collapsed, killing two students due to negligence during this boom. Crime also skyrocketed once again following the immigration boom which caused a great retaliation by the Tokushu Ky\u016bsh\u016b Butai (Special Assault Team.) International incidents began to occur as sightings of Police Brutality became more and more apparent. In 2017, the island saw the arrival of the House of Herrington, a powerful aristocratic family of British origin and the majority control owners of the publicly traded Nasdaq-100 company Herrington Holdings Conglomerate. They began a systemic takeover of the island and its institutions and saved Karakura from bankruptcy following an economic implosion. In 2019, a devastating terrorist attack orchestrated by the Karakuran Anti-Government Extremists (KAGE) led to the deaths of hundreds of law enforcement and government personnel, the complete arsonry of the Mayoral Office and an unsuccessful arson of the Karakura Police Department. This led to the deaths of many notable figures, including Mayor Quinn Leighton and Police Commissioner Herrington who died in the skirmish. A state of emergency was made and saw the induction of Mayor Luke Herrington who was inducted into the position without any formal voting process as he was the runner-up in the 2019 election that had just occurred 6 months prior. </p>"},{"location":"karakura/#culture","title":"Culture","text":"<p>Karakura's culture is a harmonious blend of traditional Japanese practices and  heavy foreign influences.
